# {{ title }}

Git is a management tool used to organise and track the history of a codebase or project. These codebases in use with these tools are known as a repository. Repositories can be backed up to a remote server such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

Advantages:

- The repository can be recovered in the case that our development computer fails. Laptops have consistently failed at least once for the past 2 years, and code was lost.
- Multiple programmers can work on the repository at once, even on the same file
- It works offline&mdash;There is often no wifi present at competitions.
- Old code can be referenced for future use or reused.
- It stores file history, so older versions of files can be reverted in the case that a major bug is present, or because of malice.
- It makes it effortless to update all computers to the latest version and makes it easy to publicly share if needed.
